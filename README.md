The Linear Assigment problem may seem like something easy at a first glance

## Munkres Algorithm in PyTorch

(PAPER)


In order to make this viable, you need to implement it using "bipartite matching via shortest augmenting paths". The Munkres implementation using NP/PyTorch doesn't work in practice

## Future of this project
I may implement more version of this algorithm whenever interest comes
