# Linear Assignment Problem (LAP)

The Linear Assignment Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, where you want to find an optimial assignment between $n$ workers and $n$ tasks. Let $\{w_1, ..., w_n \}$ be the set of workers and let $\{ t_1, ..., t_n \}$ be the set of tasks. Let $c_{i,j}$ represent the cost of assigning $w_i \to t_j$ and let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of sets of $n!$ permutations of $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$, for instance $\mathcal{A} = \{(1,2,...,n), (2,1,...,n), ..., (n, n-1, ..., 1) \}$ and so on. Then we can formulate LAP as

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha^* = \underset{\alpha \in \mathcal{A}}{\arg\min} \sum_{i=1}^n c_{i,\alpha(i)}
\end{align}
$$

where $\alpha^* \in \mathcal{A}$ is the optimal assignment, where $\alpha(i)_k$ represent the index of some task in $T$ assigned to worker $w_i$, where $k$ is the index of the permutation $\alpha_k \in \mathcal{A}$. It's also common to formulate it in terms of maximization, where let's say every worker produce a gain instead of a cost.

The motivation behind LAP is to find an algorithm that is significantly more efficient than $\mathcal{O}(n!)$, which would be the brute-force approach of testing every possible permutation of assignments.

For the different LAP algorithms, it is common to formulate them in terms of either matrices or bipartite graphs. 

## Munkres Algorithm

[(PAPER)](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~saito/data/emd/munkres.pdf)

The Munkres LAP Algorithm based on previous works from other computer scientist (See paper), is a pretty intuitive version of LAP, where we can directly apply it on a matrix of costs

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{1,1} & c_{1,2} & \cdots & c_{1,n} \\
c_{2,1} & c_{2,2} & \cdots & c_{2,n} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\
c_{n,1} & c_{n,2} & \cdots & c_{n,n}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

following the above definitions. 

In practice, the Munkres Algorithm is very slow compared to newer versions of the LAP algorithm, such as the one implemented in SciPy. Thus, it's only of theoretical interest and shouldn't be used in practice. 

### Usage

First 
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then 
```python
from linear_assignment import LinearAssignmentMunkres
import torch

cost_matrix = torch.Tensor([[80, 23, 80, 39, 55, 2],
                           [19, 59, 36, 98, 19, 94],
                           [82, 38, 48, 95, 65, 25],
                           [9, 91, 83, 8, 48, 64],
                           [73, 22, 23, 86, 33, 42],
                           [2, 20, 9, 81, 94, 16]])

lap = LinearAssignmentMunkres(cost_matrix, maximize=False)
lap.fit()
indices, sum = lap.transform()
```
Where the indices consists of the assignments of row $i$Â (worker) and col $j$ (task). The sum is the minimized cost.  

## Future of this project
I may implement more efficient versions of this algorithm, starting with Jonker and Volgenant.
